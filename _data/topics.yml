  content: >
    Portraying characters is one of the most challenging aspects of building an
    engaging 3D world.  While many low-level aspects of character animation technology
    have been resolved, there are many questions that remain open as the industry
    pushes towards more procedural blend trees.  How should gestures be controlled by
    AI?  What's a way to maintain believable yet flexible locomotion?  For developers
    building simulations or games that rely heavily on characters, this track is 
    intended for you!

    How do you build your simulation to respond to user input at interactive rates,
    especially if it needs to make intelligent decisions?  Artificial intelligence
    techniques have evolved significantly over the past few years, allowing you to
    make choices about complex problem domains with any-time algorithms.  If you're
    creating intelligent runtime agents for your games, simulations or applications,
    this track will help you make the most of recent advances.

  title: "Agent Behavior"
  content: >
    As virtual worlds become more engaging, their number of agents is going up
    tremendously. From AI directors that supervise a scene, to interactive tutors, as
    well as other actors, each of them require consistent behaviors.  In this track,
    you'll learn about best practices in the field for creating virtual actors, in
    particular techniques such as behavior trees, planners, or utility systems.

  title: "Procedural Content Generation"
  content: >
    Over the past few years, procedural generation techniques have established
    themselves as not only a sensible approach but often as the default approach
    for assisting content creation.  This track focuses on the algorithms and methods
    for procedural generation, that can be applied for generating modular pieces of
    content in complex worlds or entire levels in simpler games/simulations.  If
    you're looking to improve the unique feel and replayability of your games, or
    reduce overheads creating content, this is your day!

    Creating emergent simulations that go beyond scripted linear experiences has
    proven a great way of engaging audiences.  However, there are huge challenges
    in both design and technology for implementing these.  How to combine top-down
    control and bottom-up behaviors?  What's required to keep the player experience
    entertaining?  Which design tools can be used to assist the process?  This
    track will dig further into each of these topics.
