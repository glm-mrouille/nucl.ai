                <p>The nucl.ai&trade; conference grew out of the Game/AI Conference (in its 7<sup>th</sup> edition) as the largest worldwide event dedicated to its topic.  The event brings together hundreds of professional developers, enthusiasts and practitioners from Europe and beyond!</p>

                <p>Over the years, we've noticed best practices and techniques are often widely applicable to other industries, and our audience broadened considerably.  This year the conference is switching to a multi-track format with multiple topics running in tandem during the same day.</p>

                <p>This event is perfect for you if you're interested in digging into depth on business-critical subjects, stay up-to-date of upcoming technology, and establish contacts with other companies in the field.  Join us in Vienna/Austria in July; tickets available from March 16th!</p>
